## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [API](https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation.html)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot while building this app. I learned how to interact with remote API servers and how to populate the UI with incoming responses from servers. I have used a different API for tracking IP's than what was recommended by Frontend mentors. The API I used allows upto 10000 calls a month as opposed to only 1000 calls on the recommended one. Of course, I'm not sutisfied by this change for the API i used is less accurate when revealing locations.
